# VeggieFresh 

It is a Realtime Vegetable Order Tracking Application in which user can order fresh vegetables with Card Payment/Cash On Delivery Payment after logging into the app. Admin(farmer or vendor) can track the status of all the current vegetables orders with their payment status. User can also track the status of their vegetables order which gets updated in realtime at the both ends(user & admin). User can see all their past orders as well. 


Frontend part of this app is built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, backend part using nodejs & express. Realtime communication between both ends is implemented using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) and Card Payment is integrated using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-in)
